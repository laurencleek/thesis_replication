Classify excerpts from a central banker speech as one of the following categories: 
-	Classify the excerpts as either financial, monetary, or fiscal dominance when there is a hierarchy between the central bank and another actor. Monetary dominance if the central banker is explicitly or implicitly prescribing a policy to others. Financial or fiscal dominance if the central banker explicitly or implicitly suggests that monetary policy will accommodate other policies.
-	Classify it as fiscal-monetary coordination or monetary-financial coordination when there is not a clear hierarchy and there is a request to coordinate or cooperate.
